<p>Space Grotesk is a sans-serif typeface based on Colophon Foundry’s <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono">Space Mono</a>. The typeface was modified to be proportional rather than monospaced, with emphasis on greater legibility. Still, it retains some of the quirkiness of the original typeface, such as the strictly geometric forms contrasting with grotesque details.</p>

<p>The Space Grotesk family offers three more weights, currently ranging from Light to Bold. Typographic features include old-style figures, superscript and subscript numerals, fractions, directional arrows, and multiple stylistic alternates.</p>
